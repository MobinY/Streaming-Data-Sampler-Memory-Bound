\section{Appendix}
In \cite[Proposition 1]{JowhariST11} it is shown that $\randcom^{\rightarrow,pub}_\delta(\ur_k) = O(\min\{n,t\log^2 n\})$ for $t = \max\{k,\log(1/\delta)\}$. Here we show that a minor modification of their argument in fact shows the correct complexity $\randcom^{\rightarrow,pub}_\delta(\ur_k) = O(\min\{n,t\log^2(n/t)\})$, which is optimal up to a constant factor for the full range of $n,k,\delta$ given our lower bound.
