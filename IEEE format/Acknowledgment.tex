\section*{Acknowledgment}
Wwe thank Vasileios Nakos for pointing out that our $\ur^\subset$ lower bound immediately implies a tight lower bound for finding a duplicate in data streams as well. We also thank T.S.\ Jayram for slightly sharpening the statement of Lemma~\ref{lem:information} (the sharpened version is included here), and also showing us an alternate proof.
