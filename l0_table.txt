For each problem/paper, figure out what they need. To get failure probability 1/3, they need l0-sampling_k with what delta? What k? Do they really need l0-sampling or did it suffice to have any element of the support? Or did they need another distribution?

connectivity [AGM12a]: suppfind_1, delta = .01

k-connectivity [AGM12a]: suppfind_1, says delta = .01 but it seems we need delta = O(1/lg k) (???)

bipartiteness [AGM12a]: suppfind_1, delta = .01

minimum spanning tree [AGM12a]: suppfind_1, delta ~ epsilon/lg(W) where all edge weights are in [W] and we want the approx MST weight up to 1+epsilon

subgraph counting [AGM12b]: (ell_0)_k for k ~ eps^{-2} lg(1/delta), and failure prob. delta
